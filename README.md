# SiteBuildTest
This is my solution for a test required during the hiring process of a company I am applying for.

I tried to remain pure css/html5 for everything but had to add a little angular app to show/hide the menu according to the user clicking the respective buttons.
(Thank you very much for forcing me to make this exercise, it made me value Sass and bootstrap a lot more!)

The css is divided in several files for clarity. As this test was concentrating on responsive design only, I decided that minifying and reuniting them all in 1 file was unnecessary. Obviously, in a production environment, it would have to be done in order to improve performances.

I only took in consideration those breakpoints for screen sizes (following bootstrap3): desktop normal screen, tablet, phone small screen.

The language selector is not a selector. (didn't seem like the point of the test)

The application was tested on chrome.
