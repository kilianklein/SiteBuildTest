# SiteBuildTest
This is my solution for a test required during the hiring process of a company I am applying for.

The css is divided in several files for clarity, as this test was concentrating on responsive design only, I decided that minifying and reunite it all in 1 file was unnecessary. Obviously, in a production environment, it would have to be done in order to improve performances.
The language selector is not a selector.
